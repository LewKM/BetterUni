## Background/Introduction

We observed that many high school graduates face difficulties in selecting suitable university courses due to a lack of information about the courses' content and future career prospects. BetterUni aims to bridge this gap by providing a system that helps students make well-informed decisions based on their grades and preferences.

## Problem Statement

The current higher education placement system in Kenya, KUCCPS, often leaves students confused about their course choices, leading to high dropout rates and lower enrollment in postgraduate courses. BetterUni seeks to address this issue by offering a comprehensive system that provides detailed information about potential courses and their requirements.

## Justification

BetterUni will provide an interactive decision support system that evaluates students' high school grades and matches them with suitable university courses. The system will also offer resources like sample notes, past papers, and assignments to prepare students for their chosen courses. This approach will help reduce dropout rates and improve students' overall success in higher education.

## Research Methods and Design

We will use a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods, including participant interviews and questionnaires, to gather data on the current higher education placement system and the challenges students face. This data will inform the development of BetterUni and help us design a system that meets students' needs.

## Methodology
